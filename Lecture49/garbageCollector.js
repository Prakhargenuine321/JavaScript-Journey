//Garbage Collector
//Memory management tool.
//It is used to free up the memory that is no longer in use and increase efficiency of an program.
//Also prevent memory leaks(aisi memory jo free hai but hum uska use nahi kar pa rahe hain).
//We have no control over garbage collector and we cannot code it , it always runs in background.
